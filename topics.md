## Course Project Topics

This course offers **7 curated project topics** for group work. Students work in groups (3-4 members) to select **one topic** for their final project. Groups work on their chosen topic throughout the semester, applying all course skills learned in lectures—from data import and cleaning to statistical analysis and professional reporting.

Each topic includes a curated dataset with detailed instructions. Groups report on their project progress during each lab week, building toward a comprehensive final presentation in Week 15.
